Question 1:
    (a) 5 < 8 (True, 8 is bigger than 5)
    (b) '10' < '8' (True, '1' is in order before than '8')
    (c) '5' < '8' (True, '5' is in order before than '8')
    (d) 'Jake' < 'Brian' (False, 'B' is in order before than 'J')

    True is (a), (b), (c)


Question 2:
    (a) not in 24 nums
    (b) 'Ellen' in names
    (c) 'Morris' in last_name or 'Morrison' in last_name


Question 3:
    First, num is to be a type int so it could be changed like this.
    num = int(input('Enter first number: '))
    Next, when user inputs '0', product value goes 0.
    So we have to use if, else for being zero when user input 0.
    Last, the last line that print('product = ', product) should not be in the
    while loop. It has to be left-sided.

Question 4:
    print("John Doe\n123 Main Street\nAnytown, Maryland 21009")

Question 5:
    print("It's raining today.")

Question 6:
    (a) 12 / 6.0 --> 2.0
    (b) 21 // 10 --> 2
    (c) 25 // 10.0 --> 2.0
